# Supporter Follow-Up Templates

## 1. Thank-You + Next Steps
_Subject: Thank you for pledging support_

Hi {Name},

Thank you so much for committing {percentage}% toward the flight. I’ll keep you posted as we approach the booking date—expect a note with the exact dollar figure once fares are locked in (currently estimating ${minAmount}-${maxAmount}).

In the meantime, if your plans shift or you’d like more detail on the research threads, just reply. I appreciate you being part of this experiment.

With gratitude,
Ilya

## 2. “No Pressure” Response
_Subject: Thanks for considering it_

Hi {Name},

Thanks for taking a look at the pledge page. No pressure at all—whether or not this fits right now, I’m glad to have you in the loop. If you’re curious about the research (Pollyanna, PrayerLift, etc.), I’m always happy to share a deeper dive.

Take good care,
Ilya

## 3. Payment Details (when booking is imminent)
_Subject: Locking in the GitHub Universe flight_

Hi {Name},

We hit 100%, and I’m about to book the flight for ${finalCost}. Your {percentage}% pledge comes to ${amountDue}. Here’s the simplest way to send it:

- Preferred: {PaymentMethod} ({details})
- Alternative: {BackupMethod}

If the timing or amount is tough, just tell me—this is a trust-based experiment. Once the trip is booked I’ll follow up with notes and prototypes.

Thanks again,
Ilya

## 4. Acknowledging a Change of Plans
_Subject: Thanks for letting me know_

Hi {Name},

Totally understand—thanks for giving me the heads up. I’ll adjust the pledge sheet on my side and dial the anchor sponsor back up. If circumstances change later, you’re always welcome to jump back in.

Appreciate the support either way,
Ilya

## 5. Sharing Post-Trip Outcomes
_Subject: GitHub Universe – here’s what you backed_

Hi {Name},

Just wanted to close the loop now that the trip’s complete. Highlights you helped make possible:

- {Key insight prototype}
- {New connection or partnership}
- {Resource or write-up}

I’m packaging fuller notes for supporters soon. If you want to stay plugged into experiments like Pollyanna or PrayerLift, let me know. Thanks again for co-owning this research.

With appreciation,
Ilya
