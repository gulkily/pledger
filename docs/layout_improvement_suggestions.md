# Layout Improvement Suggestions (Oct 2025 screenshot)

1. **Elevate the hero**: Add a two-column structure with a profile card on the left and headline copy on the right, ensuring the avatar aligns vertically with the story card to reduce vertical jump.
2. **Simplify gradients**: Replace the heavy purple gradient background with a neutral canvas (light gray) so the content cards stand out like GitHub issues/projects.
3. **Unify card spacing**: Apply consistent 24–28px padding, 12px border radius, and subtle 1px borders on the story, chart, and form cards to mimic GitHub’s notebook feel.
4. **Countdown highlight**: Move the “Need to book by” block into a full-width pill above the stats, using a muted blue background and small calendar icon to increase urgency.
5. **Chart context**: Add a “Supporter goal” banner above the donut that clarifies the 40% target and lighten the ring gradient to avoid overpowering text.
6. **Sponsor list readability**: Alternate row background colors or add chips with initials; include relative timestamps (“2h ago”) and show pledge % in bold with dollar range below.
7. **Pledge form grouping**: Separate the public and private fields using subtle headings (“Public details”, “Coordinating details”) for better scanning.
8. **FAQ integration**: Use GitHub-style disclosure components so the FAQ stack doesn’t create extra scroll; default the first FAQ open.
9. **Call-to-action bar**: Consider a sticky footer on mobile with pledge progress and a “Commit” button to capture users after they scroll through context.
10. **Dark mode**: Provide theme-aware colors with `prefers-color-scheme` and a manual toggle so the page blends with GitHub’s dark UI when preferred.
