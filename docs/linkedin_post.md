# LinkedIn Post Draft â€“ GitHub Universe Sponsorship

Hey friends, FOSS folks, and supporters ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve been invited to GitHub Universe this year, and Iâ€™m asking for a little help to get there. My day job is maintaining and building open source tools so teams everywhere can ship faster. Universe is where I get to sharpen that craft, trade notes with other maintainers, and bring back ideas that make our tooling better for everyone.

Hereâ€™s the ask: Iâ€™m crowdfunding the flight. Supporters pledge a percentage of the ticket, and I only tap you for your share once Iâ€™m ready to book (deadline is tomorrow!). In return Iâ€™ll deliver:

- A concise recap of the most actionable sessions for FOSS builders
- Early prototypes and experiments inspired by the trip
- Shout-outs and attribution in anything that ships because of the conversations I have there

If that sounds like upside youâ€™d like to share in, hereâ€™s the pledge page with all the details and live progress: https://ilyagulko.com/pledger

Every pledgeâ€”no matter the sizeâ€”helps keep this kind of independent open source work sustainable. Thanks for considering it, and feel free to DM if you want to chat before committing.
