# LinkedIn Post Draft – GitHub Universe Sponsorship

Friends, builders, and community stewards — I’ve been offered a meaningful chance to improve how we gather online, and I’d love for you to be part of it.

GitHub Universe asked me to join this year. My current research is all about designing healthier online community spaces: open-source tools that foster belonging, reduce burnout for moderators, and give people rituals that feel human. One longtime collaborator already volunteered to fund the entire flight, but I’d rather turn this into a shared experiment in community-supported research. We co-invest in the learning, and we all absorb the breakthroughs.

Here’s the opportunity:
- **Deadline is tomorrow**. I need to book the flight, and every percentage pledged today lightens the anchor sponsor’s load.
- **You get first-look impact.** I’ll deliver a crisp Universe recap focused on community infrastructure, share prototypes and rituals sparked by the conference, and host a private debrief for supporters.
- **Your name travels with the work.** Every project or paper that emerges from these conversations will credit the people who made the trip possible.

The pledge model is simple: you commit a percentage of the ticket, I only collect once everything is ready to book, and if plans change, no funds move. Consider it a low-risk way to accelerate OSS research into more humane digital spaces.

If you believe healthy online communities are worth investing in, this is your moment to help shape them. Join the supporter circle here (live progress + all details): https://ilyagulko.com/pledger

Let’s make this trip—and the insights it unlocks—something the whole community benefits from. DM me if you want to talk through it before pledging. Thank you for considering it, and for everything you already do to make the internet kinder.
