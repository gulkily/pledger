# LinkedIn Post Draft – GitHub Universe Sponsorship

I'm heading to GitHub Universe to advance research on healthier online communities—and I'm inviting you to co-own the learning.

My work right now is laser-focused on designing community infrastructure that actually works: open-source moderation tools that prevent burnout, participation rituals that feel human instead of transactional, and spaces where belonging doesn't require performing. A longtime collaborator already offered to fund the entire trip, but here's why I'm not taking that deal.

**Single-sponsor funding keeps research insular. Community-backed research distributes both the risk and the breakthroughs.**

When a community co-invests, everyone gets upstream access to the insights. You're not a donor—you're a research partner with early visibility into what gets built next.

## Here's what happens:

You pledge any percentage of the $556 flight cost (5%, 25%, whatever fits). I collect only when we hit 100%. If we don't, my collaborator covers it anyway—**so your downside is zero, but your upside is direct influence on OSS community tooling.**

## What you get:

- **Immediate conference debrief** for all supporters: key patterns, surprising conversations, and which ideas are ready to prototype
- **First access** to any tools, frameworks, or documented rituals that emerge from Universe conversations
- **Credit in perpetuity**: every paper, prototype, or talk that traces back to this trip will acknowledge the people who funded it

The flight books in two days, October 23. Every pledge today means more people have ownership over this research, and more communities benefit from what we learn.

If you want to talk through the model, specific deliverables, or how your pledge gets used—DM me. I'm especially interested in hearing what community infrastructure problems you'd want me to prioritize in conversations there.

The internet doesn't have to be exhausting. Let's fund the research that makes it sustainable.
