Hi {Name},

I’m about to publish a pledge page for funding my GitHub Universe trip. Because you know the work I’m doing—consent-first community tooling, PrayerLift experiments, and Pollyanna—I’d value your feedback before I post it widely.

Would you mind giving https://ilyagulko.com/pledger a quick read and telling me if anything feels unclear or heavy? Don’t worry about pledging; I’m just pressure-testing the story.

Thank you!
Ilya
