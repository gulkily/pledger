            <h1>ðŸš€ Co-fund research for healthier online communities</h1>
            <p>Iâ€™m heading to GitHub Universe to advance community infrastructure researchâ€”and Iâ€™d love you to co-own the learning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-card">
            <h2>Why this trip matters</h2>
            <p>
                My current work is laser-focused on open source infrastructure that keeps online communities healthy:
                humane moderation tooling, participation rituals that feel welcoming, and spaces where belonging doesnâ€™t
                require performance. GitHub Universe is where I can pressure-test those ideas with other people building in
                the same direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                A long-time collaborator already offered to pay for the flight, but Iâ€™d rather distribute both the risk and
                the breakthroughs. When the community co-invests, the insights belong to everyoneâ€”not just the person who
                can underwrite a plane ticket.
            </p>
            <p>
                This pledge drive is an experiment in community-supported research: you pledge a percentage today, I only
                collect if/when we book, and you receive first access to conference notes, prototypes, and rituals that come
                out of the trip. Your downside is zero; your upside is direct influence on OSS community tooling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Booking deadline is tight, and every percentage pledged today lightens the anchor sponsorâ€™s load. Thank you
                for backing meaningful, community-focused FOSS research.
            </p>
