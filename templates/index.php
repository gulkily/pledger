            <h2>Why this trip matters</h2>
            <p>
                My current work is laser-focused on open source infrastructure that keeps online communities healthy:
                humane moderation tooling, participation rituals that feel welcoming, and spaces where belonging doesnâ€™t
                require performance. GitHub Universe is where I can pressure-test those ideas with other people building in
                the same direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                A long-time collaborator already offered to pay for the flight, but Iâ€™d rather distribute both the risk and
                the breakthroughs. When the community co-invests, the insights belong to everyoneâ€”not just the person who
                can underwrite a plane ticket.
            </p>
            <p>
                This pledge drive is an experiment in community-supported research: you pledge a percentage today, I only
                collect if/when we book, and you receive first access to conference notes, prototypes, and rituals that come
                out of the trip. Your downside is zero; your upside is direct influence on OSS community tooling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Youâ€™ll be able to edit or cancel your pledge later from this browserâ€”keep the tab bookmarked and the session
                remembers you for future supporter-only experiments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Booking deadline is tight, and every percentage pledged today lightens the anchor sponsorâ€™s load. Thank you
                for backing meaningful, community-focused FOSS research.
            </p>

                <h3>How do I update or cancel my pledge?</h3>
                <p>As long as you revisit from this browser, youâ€™ll see manage buttons to edit or remove your pledge. If you lose access (cleared storage, new device), reply to the follow-up email and Iâ€™ll handle it manually.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>When will I actually pay?</h3>
                <p>Iâ€™ll follow up right before booking to confirm your pledge amount based on the final ticket priceâ€”no funds move until that moment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is there an automated checkout?</h3>
                <p>Not this time. This sprint is deliberately lightweight and last-minute, so once we hit 100% Iâ€™ll reach out personally with a payment link or transfer instructions. Think of it as a manually orchestrated experiment rather than a SaaS flow.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What if my situation changes?</h3>
                <p>This is a trust-based collaboration. If life shiftsâ€”expenses pop up, you get cold feet, or the final number feels heavyâ€”let me know. I wonâ€™t auto-charge or chase anyone; weâ€™ll adjust the pledge or hand it back to the anchor sponsor.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What happens to the anchor sponsor?</h3>
                <p>Your pledges shrink their commitment. If we push past 100%, Iâ€™ll scale everyoneâ€™s share down proportionally so the anchorâ€”and every supporterâ€”only pays whatâ€™s still needed.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What if the trip falls through?</h3>
                <p>No funds are collected until the flight is purchased. If plans change, Iâ€™ll let everyone know and no pledges will be called in.</p>
