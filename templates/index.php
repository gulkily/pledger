            <h1>ðŸš€ Fuel a FOSS maintainerâ€™s trip to GitHub Universe</h1>
            <p>Iâ€™m researching healthier online community spaces through open source and need support to keep learning.</p>

            <h2>Why this trip matters</h2>
            <p>
                I build and study free and open source tools that help communities connect, moderate, and grow with less
                friction. GitHub Universe is where I can learn from other researchers and maintainers experimenting with
                digital gathering spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your pledge funds the flight. In return, Iâ€™ll share conference learnings, research notes, prototypes, and
                practical takeaways with the supporters who make the trip possibleâ€”so any benefits from this visit ripple
                back to the people backing it.
            </p>
            <p>
                One long-time collaborator has already stepped up to cover the entire ticket if needed. Iâ€™d love to lighten
                their load and turn this into a shared effort from the community that benefits most from the research.
            </p>
            <p>
                This pledge drive is an experiment in community-supported research: can we fund the learning together and
                then share whatever insights emerge so everyone gains?
            </p>
            <p>
                Booking deadline is tight, and every percentage pledged brings us closer to liftoff. Thank you for
                helping me keep meaningful community-focused FOSS work sustainable.
            </p>
